### License
The project was carried out as part of the 2020/2021 '<b>Project Methodology</b>' course at <b>VIA University</b> where, together with a business analysis carried out by Business Engineering students, it was awarded a score of 10/12.

## Project Specifications
The requirements for the project were to define, design and develop some kind of product, which had to be created following best practices and supported by a business analysis of the idea.

In this specific case, the project team decided to develop a social network based around cooking and eating, with the purpose of helping people connect through food and get to know new cultures and traditions.

The social network allows for the registration and interaction of users, who can create and join food-based events in which participants can be asked to bring specific ingredients or tools, and that allows them to communicate using a built-in chat system.

Participants can also provide ratings to one another in relation to a certain shared event, contributing to a global peer-awarded score for each user.

In support of the `Vue.js` framework both `Vuex` storage and `Vue Router` were employed, and `Google Firebase` was used to persist information.
